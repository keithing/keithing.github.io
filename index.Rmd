About
=====

Hi, I'm Keith Ingersoll.  I'm a senior data scientist at Civis Analytics.
I work on NLP problems and maintain the Python and R client libraries for
the Civis API.  I tweet using the handle
[`@_keithing`](https://twitter.com/_keithing) and I can be found on Github
under the name [`keithing`](https://github.com/keithing). Come talk to me
about machine learning, funk, film noir, or indie videogames!
